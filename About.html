                <h3>About Travis</h3>
                <br>
                <p> <i>Travis Dusing</i> was born in the town of Hibbing, Minnesota to Lance and Kristine Dusing. Travis grew up with 3 siblings. His Sisters Melisa and Nikole and his 
                    brother David. Of the four, Travis was the youngest. Though he would only spend a few short years in Minnesota, the state left a mark on him and set him on a 
                    path that would define his friendships, hobbies, and life. Around the age of 6, Lance Dusing would take a job in Arizona leading to Travis spending 2 years in 
                    Arizona. At the age of 8, Travis and his family moved and settled in South Dakota in a small town called Dell Rapids. Dell Rapids had a population of around 3000 
                    at the time and would be a new experience for the youngest Dusing.</p><br /><br />

                <p>In Minnesota, as well as Arizona, the classes consisted of hundreds of students. In Dell Rapids, the class sizes were only 80-90 students.
                    This made it easy for him to find the only other student, and eventually life-long friend, who shared 
                    his love for hockey. Travis began playing hockey about the same time he learned to walk. His father Lance had spent his whole life playing hockey in Minnesota 
                    and the state of hockey adopted Travis into its long line of hockey playing Minnesota. However, moving out of the state of Minnesota would make it hard to find 
                    others also interested in hockey. To even play hockey, Travis had to travel 30 minutes south to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He would meet his friend, Drew, 
                    who was the only other student in the Dell Rapids school district who played hockey due to this connection. Hockey would ultimately drive many of Travisâ€™s 
                    friendships throughout his life.<br /><br />

                    Through high school, Travis would continue to play hockey, but also ran Track and Field for the school. His senior year of 
                    high school he would bring home several 1st place medals for his participation in relays. That year he also graduated with 32 credits, resulting in him joining 
                    his brother David and Sister Melisa as 1 of only 6 students who took a full credit load in high school at Dell Rapids. After High School, Travis would attend 
                    school for IT at Southeast Technical College and eventually would take a job with Midco as a Field Technician, maintaining and installing internet infrastructure.</p>
