                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <br>
                <p> Throughout Travis's life, there would be many activities he would participate in, but one would trump them all. For Travis, hockey was
                    his passion. Travis started skating shortly after he learned to walk and continues to play hockey to this day. As a child, Travis would often attend His
                    fathers men's league games. Now, at the age of 29, he has been lucky enough to play alongside Lance in men's league games and tournaments.  Hockey has also 
                    allowed him to stay in touch with friends he grew up playing hockey with. Interested in learning more about hockey? <a href="https://thehockeywriters.com/hockey-101-beginners-guide-ice-hockey/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a>.<br><br>
                    Hockey hasn't been the only hobby Travis has partaken in. Travis also played golf through high school and continues to spend time every summer going
                    out golfing with family and friends. Hockey may take up the winter season, but through the summer, golf has been a great way to get some exercise in
                    and enjoy the outdoors. When he isn't playing hockey or golf, Travis enjoys some time playing video games or going out and running.
